# Role 3 — Perform the ticket (complete)

Provisioning left you a worktree on `feature/<ticket>` with the spec workflow
open. This is the rest: implement, run the loop to green, close the spec workflow
and the issue, verify the merge, open the PR, and — for an integration repo — fan
out to the constituents.

## 1. Implement in the worktree

Edit in the worktree only, never the primary checkout.

- **PLAIN repo:** edit the files the References section pointed at.
- **INTEGRATION repo:** edit across constituent files in the **one parent
  worktree** — `constituents/<name>/...` are plain files here. Do not run git
  inside a constituent directory; there is no `.git` there during the ticket.

If the issue carries a `## Goals & evaluation` section, read it **before** the
first edit: its expected effect is the result this change is aiming at, and
reading it afterwards means every design choice was already made without it.
`N/A: <reason>` means this issue has no measurable outcome — nothing to run,
nothing to report beyond saying so. See `references/goal-signal.md`.

## 2. Run the validation loop to green

Drive `specs/current` → `specs/desired_program_model` with all four layers green,
per `references/validation-loop.md`. For an integration repo this loop runs **at
the parent only**. Do not exit this step until the loop's definition-of-done is
fully checked.

When the issue declares a goal, also run its local signal once the four layers
are green — the loop's advisory fifth layer. Store the output under the ticket's
evidence path and classify it (moved as expected / moved less than expected / no
measurable movement / moved the wrong way). It is recorded and reported, never
green-or-red: the four layers decide whether this ticket passes, and the issue's
named evaluation decides the goal.

## 3. Close the spec workflow

The loop already closes each ticket as its slice converges. Before promoting,
confirm **every** ticket in `ticket_plan.yaml` is closed — not just the last one —
closing any stragglers with the `tla-spec-dev` CLI, then promote the workflow:

```bash
# close any ticket still open (repeat per ticket id)
tla-spec-dev --spec-root specs close ticket <ticket-id> --summary "<what landed>" --result <evidence-path>

# every ticket closed in the plan, model promoted, workflow dirs removed
python <tla-spec-dev-skill>/scripts/close_tickets.py --repo-root . \
  --summary "Promoted desired/current into program_model"
ls specs/                     # specs/current and specs/desired_program_model should be gone
```

Attach the test-graph reports to the in-repo spec ticket the workflow tracked, so
the passing evidence is tied to the ticket that closed — not only to the PR.

## 4. Commit the change

Only after the loop is green and the spec workflow is closed:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<ticket>: <what changed> — specs, graph, adapters, tests"
```

## 5. Bring the branch back and verify the merge

### PLAIN repo

Push, open the PR, then land it yourself — rebase and merge via `gh` rather than
leaving it for someone else to merge later. Close-out isn't done until the change
is actually on `main`.

```bash
git push -u origin feature/<ticket>
gh pr create --fill --body "Closes #<n>

Graphs run: <named graphs incl. specWorkflow>. Reports attached to the spec ticket.

## Goal contribution

| Goal | Contribution | Expected effect | Measured local signal | Decided by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <goal> | direct | <expected effect> | <value + classification> — <evidence path> | <evaluation issue, or this issue's own harness run> |"
gh pr merge --rebase
```

One row per goal the issue declared, including any whose signal was
`N/A: <reason>`; `None declared` when the issue declared none, so a reader can
tell that apart from a goal that was ignored. "No measurable movement" and "moved
the wrong way" are reported, not omitted — and neither is a reason to hold the
PR, tune the change, or re-run until the number improves
(`references/goal-signal.md`). An issue whose own slice **is** the measurement
reports `## Goal verdicts` instead: baseline → measured → target with a `met` /
`missed` / `unmeasured` verdict, **one row per clause** where the target has
more than one — a single token has to pick a clause and picks the flattering
one.

If the rebase merge is blocked (required review, branch protection, merge
conflict), stop and surface that instead of forcing it — don't bypass a real gate.

Verify it actually merged before cleanup:

```bash
gh pr view --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit   # state MERGED, mergedAt set
git -C <repo-root> fetch origin
git -C <repo-root> branch --merged origin/main | grep feature/<ticket>   # branch is in main
```

### INTEGRATION repo

Merge the parent feature branch back into the integration **main** tree, then let
`git-integration-repo`'s verifier assert the tree is clean and every constituent is
still wired — this is how you confirm the change landed properly across the parent:

```bash
INT="${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}/skills/git-integration-repo/scripts"
git -C <repo-root> merge --no-ff feature/<ticket>
"$INT/verify.sh"               # parent tree clean + every constituent has its .git + origin
```

A dirty tree or an unwired constituent here means the merge is not safe to fan out
— stop and reconcile before step 7.

## 6. Close out the worktree's home, then remove the worktree, then sync the root

Only once the merge is verified (PLAIN: PR merged; INTEGRATION: merged to main and
`verify.sh` clean).

### 6a. The gate — run it BEFORE anything is deleted

`git worktree remove` deletes `<worktree>/.skill-manager` without asking, and it
succeeds exactly as quietly whether that home held a week of skill edits or
nothing at all. The home is gitignored, so the loss appears in no diff, in no PR,
and in no fan-out. Everything in steps 1–5 was about the repository's files; this
step is about the units you were *using*, which live somewhere the repository
cannot see.

```bash
skill-manager home close-out --home ../wt-<ticket>/.skill-manager \
                             --into <repo-root>/.skill-manager
```

`--into` is the **project** home — the main working tree's, the one this
worktree's home was cloned from. Not `~/.skill-manager`: the pair has to be the
one the copy was actually made from, or the verdict is about the wrong two homes.

Read the verdict, not the exit code alone. There are four exits and only one of
them prints blockers:

- **exit 0** — "holds nothing that removing it would destroy". Proceed.
- **exit 2** — the path you gave `--home` is **not a home**. Nothing was
  assessed, so nothing is printed. Almost always you passed the worktree
  directory rather than its `.skill-manager` — which is also the path
  `git worktree remove` takes, so this exit is the one standing between a typo
  and a silent "safe" verdict about the directory holding the only copy.
- **exit 9** — the destination home's policy is `frozen`, so the gate was
  refused and **nothing was attempted**. This is not a statement about your
  work; `9` ("refused, nothing attempted") is not `1` ("this worktree still
  holds work"). Either unfreeze the destination
  (`skill-manager home policy live --home <repo-root>/.skill-manager`) or pass a
  different `--into`.
- **exit 1** — the real verdict: this worktree holds work. Each blocking unit is
  printed with its `status` and the literal command that clears it. There are
  only two shapes of remedy, and they answer different questions:

  ```bash
  # Move the edit UP A TIER, so closing this worktree does not take it with it.
  # Local to this machine. --merge is a three-way against the recorded baseline;
  # a conflict is reported and left for you, and a conflicted unit writes nothing.
  skill-manager home sync --from ../wt-<ticket>/.skill-manager \
                          --to <repo-root>/.skill-manager --merge

  # Push the edit to the UNIT'S OWN GIT REPO. This is the only path that reaches
  # a sibling project, and the only one that survives this machine.
  skill-manager unit publish <unit> --ticket <ticket>
  ```

  They are not alternatives. A sync-only chain would need the same improvement
  merged up twice and would still never reach another project. If you improved a
  skill during this ticket, `unit publish` is the one you owe; `home sync` only
  stops the worktree teardown destroying it.

  A `LINKED` blocker means the gate **cannot tell** whose bytes those are —
  resolve the symlink first. "Cannot tell" blocks on purpose; clearing it is how
  `clean: true` came to be printed for a home whose whole `skills/` directory was
  a link.

Use `--json` when you want to act on `.blockers[]` programmatically. The command
writes nothing and is safe to re-run after each remedy.

Prefer the wrapper in **both** repo shapes — it does the gate and the removal in
the right order and refuses (exit 4) on a non-zero verdict:

```bash
WT="${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}/skills/git-issue-workflow/scripts/wt"
"$WT" close <ticket>                       # add --dry-run to just ask
```

`wt close` forwards to `close-change.sh`; a successful close prints one line
naming the worktree, the branch that outlives it, and the home tier its skill
work reached. `--dry-run` and `--force` print the full key set instead. It
resolves the ticket by searching where ticket worktrees live, so it runs from a
checkout other than the one that opened the worktree — but it must be run from
inside **some** git repository (from a non-repo directory it exits 1 with
`not inside a git repository`).

`close-change.sh --force` still runs the gate and still prints every blocker; it
only declines to stop, and it says the work is being discarded. It exists so that
someone throwing away a spike uses a named, loud override instead of `rm -rf`,
which skips this check and every other one. `--force` is not on
`skill-manager home close-out` itself — the CLI's job is the verdict, the script's
job is whether to obey it. Never reach for it to get past a blocker you have not
read.

### 6b. After the removal

The removal itself already happened in 6a — `skt ticket close <ticket>` (or
`"$WT" close <ticket>`, or the `close-out && git worktree remove` pair with
its `&&` intact). There is deliberately no bare `git worktree remove` step
here: run bare, it deletes the worktree's home — and every unpublished skill
edit in it — without a word, which is the exact loss the gate in 6a exists to
prevent. What remains is syncing the primary checkout:

**PLAIN:** the primary checkout never touched this ticket's commits — they only
exist on the remote until you pull. Sync it to the new `main` before you consider
the ticket closed:

```bash
git -C <repo-root> checkout main
git -C <repo-root> pull origin main
git -C <repo-root> worktree prune
git -C <repo-root> branch -d feature/<ticket>   # local branch is merged; safe to drop
```

**INTEGRATION:** step 5's `git merge --no-ff feature/<ticket>` already updated
`<repo-root>` directly, so just prune the stale worktree registration:

```bash
git -C <repo-root> worktree prune
```

## 7. Close the GitHub issue

If the PR carried `Closes #<n>`, merging closes the issue automatically — confirm
it. Otherwise close it with a summary:

```bash
gh issue view <n> --json state,closed          # confirm CLOSED after PR merge
# if still open:
gh issue close <n> --comment "Completed on feature/<ticket>. Graphs: <named graphs incl. specWorkflow>. Spec workflow promoted; reports attached to the spec ticket."
```

## 8. INTEGRATION only — fan out to constituents

For an integration repo, the parent PR is not the end. Each constituent needs its
own `feature/<ticket>` branch, PR, and **agent tag**, because each constituent runs
its *own* spec/test-graph loops downstream. Do this now via
`references/integration-fanout.md`.

## Close-out checklist

- [ ] PLAIN: PR opened with `Closes #<n>`, rebase-merged into `main` via `gh pr merge --rebase`, merge verified
- [ ] PR body carries `## Goal contribution` (or `None declared`)
- [ ] INTEGRATION: parent merged to main and `verify.sh` clean
- [ ] `home close-out` run and clean (or every blocker cleared by `home sync --merge` / `unit publish`) **before** any removal
- [ ] Any skill improvement made inside the worktree's home published to that unit's own repo
- [ ] Worktree removed
- [ ] Project root (`<repo-root>`) synced to the new `main`
- [ ] GitHub issue closed via `gh`
